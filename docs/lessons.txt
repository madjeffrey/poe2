Notes:
- For low cutoff games, clusters are better
- For games that must terminate, long bars save an entire game of losing. So you must cut off long bars for the opponent. 




New agents:
Denfence
- creates a wall that divides it in half
- playes like that hexagon game, down the center

RL agent:
- learns how to win by getting rewarded for winning
Problems:
- how to store the solutions, 
- for a 10 by 10 board would need 160 bits for a hashmap
    soln:
    - make the games with cutoff so that it can terminate faster if playing wellm
